Certainly! Here's an example Python script that uses the Blender Python API to attach a shirt (in .gltf format) to a hanger (in .blend format):

```python
import bpy
import sys

# Set the input parameters
blender_file = sys.argv[5]  # Path to the Blender file (.blend)
script_file = sys.argv[6]   # Path to the Python script file (.py)
gltf_file = sys.argv[7]     # Path to the shirt file (.gltf)

# Load the Blender file
bpy.ops.wm.open_mainfile(filepath=blender_file)

# Import the shirt
bpy.ops.import_scene.gltf(filepath=gltf_file)

# Get references to the hanger and the shirt object
hanger = bpy.data.objects["hanger"]
shirt = bpy.data.objects["shirt"]

# Set the shirt's scale, rotation, and position
shirt.scale = hanger.scale  # Match the scale of the hanger
shirt.rotation_euler = hanger.rotation_euler  # Match the rotation of the hanger
shirt.location = hanger.location  # Match the position of the hanger

# Parent the shirt to the hanger
shirt.parent = hanger

# Save the modified scene
bpy.ops.wm.save_mainfile(filepath=blender_file)

# Execute the Python script
exec(compile(open(script_file).read(), script_file, 'exec'))

# Set the output path for the exported GLTF file
output_gltf_file = "output.gltf"  # Replace with your desired output file path

# Select the shirt object
shirt.select_set(True)

# Export the selected shirt object as GLTF
bpy.ops.export_scene.gltf(filepath=output_gltf_file, export_selected=True)

```

To use this script, save it as a separate Python file (e.g., `attach_shirt.py`). Then, modify your command to include the path to this Python script:

```
blender -b your_blender_file.blend -P attach_shirt.py your_gltf_file.gltf
```

Make sure to replace `your_blender_file.blend` with the path to your Blender file, and `your_gltf_file.gltf` with the path to your shirt file.

This script assumes that the hanger object in your Blender file is named "hanger" and the shirt object imported from the .gltf file is named "shirt". Modify these object names in the script if they are different in your Blender file.
